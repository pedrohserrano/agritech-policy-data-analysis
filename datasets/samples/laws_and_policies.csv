The objective is to include agriculture and forestry into European climate mitigation efforts.
This decision is a direct response to the UNFCCC decision in 2011 to revise the accounting rules for GHG emissions and removals from forests and soils. It meets international standards by maintaining the voluntary nature of accounting for draining and rewetting of wetlands, but goes beyond the UNFCCC decision by making accounting for cropland and grassland management mandatory for member states.
The new rules are intended to better recognise the efforts of farmers and forest owners to maintain carbon stored in soils and forests and to facilitate a more climate-friendly architecture (funds are available through the Common Agricultural Policy's Rural Development pillar), protecting water resources and biodiversity.
It also contains reporting requirements for Member States on their initiatives to decrease emissions from forestry and agriculture-related activities as well as increase the carbon sink.
The directive does not set targets for reducing GHG in agriculture and forestry as the accounting rules set out by this directive first need to prove to be sufficiently robust.",1,1,"'forestry', 'agricultural', 'agriculture'",8

This Strategy also constitutes the document being sent to the UNFCCC according to Portugal's international commitments. The document materialises the government's 2016 pledge to achieve carbon neutrality by the end of the period. The strategy explores the feasibility of trajectories that lead to carbon neutrality, identifies the main vectors of decarbonisation and estimates the reduction potential of the various sectors of the national economy, such as energy and industry, mobility and transport , agriculture, forests and other land uses, and waste and wastewater.<br><br>The resolution sets as an objective, for the purposes of the previous number, the reduction of GHG emissions for Portugal between 85% and 90% by 2050, compared to 2005, and the compensation of the remaining emissions through the use of soil and forests, to be achieved through a emission reduction trajectory between 45% and 55% by 2030, and between 65% and 75% by 2040, in relation to 2005.<br><br>The document details the following vectors of decarbonisation:<br>a) Decarbonise the production of electricity, eliminating the production of electricity from coal by 2030 and proceeding with the total decarbonization of the electricity system by 2050, betting on endogenous renewable resources;<br>b) Implement the energy transition, significantly increasing energy efficiency in all sectors of the economy, investing in the incorporation of endogenous renewable energy sources in final energy consumption, promoting electrification and adjusting the role of natural gas in the national energy system;<br>c) Progressively decentralize and democratize energy production, giving emphasis to the role of the consumer as an active part of the energy system;<br>d) Promote decarbonisation in the residential sector, favoring urban rehabilitation and increasing energy efficiency in buildings, promoting progressive electrification of the sector and the use of more efficient equipment, and combating energy poverty;<br>e) Decarbonise mobility, favoring the mobility system in public transport, through its strengthening and decarbonization of fleets, supporting innovative and intelligent solutions for multimodal, active, shared and sustainable mobility, as well as electric mobility and other technologies zero emissions, together with a reduction in the carbon intensity of sea and air transport, focusing on innovation, efficiency and cleaner, renewable fuels, as well as the decarbonisation of short- and long-distance transport of goods, promoting a logistical chain with a modal split that minimizes the carbon and energy intensity of the transport system, reaffirming the role of maritime and fluvial transport in conjunction with rail freight;<br>f) Promote the energy transition in industry, the incorporation of low carbon production processes and industrial symbiosis, promoting innovation and competitiveness;<br>g) Betting on sustainable agriculture, through the significant expansion of conservation agriculture and precision agriculture, substantially reducing emissions associated with livestock and the use of fertilizers and promoting innovation;<br>h) Foster carbon sequestration, through active agricultural and forest management, promoting the valorization of the territory;<br>i) Changing the paradigm of using resources in production and consumption, abandoning the linear economic model and moving to a circular and low carbon economic model;<br>j) Prevent the production of waste, increase recycling rates and very significantly reduce the deposition of waste in landfills;<br>k) Streamline the participation of cities and local administrations in decarbonisation, encouraging an integrated approach to its different vectors, in particular mobility, buildings, services and waste management, and enhancing the role they have been playing in mitigating climate change;<br>l) Stimulating research, innovation and knowledge production for neutrality in the various sectors of activity;<br>m) Make taxation an instrument for the transition to neutrality, proceeding with the elimination of environmentally harmful subsidies, reinforcing the application of the carbon tax and promoting greater taxation on the use of resources, recycling revenues for decarbonization and fair transition ;<br>n) Redirect financial flows to promote carbon neutrality, namely by promoting the development of a favorable framework for sustainable financing and greater involvement of the financial system, as well as the respective monitoring;<br>o) Promote the involvement of society in the transition,

1865,National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) for 2010-2020,"Adaptation, Energy Supply, Energy Demand","This action plan constitutes the basis for action on resource efficiency and sustainability. The strategic objective of the EU stipulates a 13% increase in renewable energy capacity by 2020. The NREAP supersedes and overwrites the preceding target and renewable energy policy, and aims to increase renewable energy within the total gross energy consumption by 14.65% by 2020. In addition, there is a target of renewable energy accounting for 4.3% of gross final consumption of energy in 2005.<br />
<br />
The NREAP identifies significant potential in renewable energy sources, but many of them face environmental concerns as barriers and funding limitation. Some 16-17MW of hydropower could realistically be installed by 2020, but environmental concerns are limiting factors. Wind energy potential reaches several thousand MW, while also considered environmentally friendly, but it needs economic justification as it is highly intermittent. Geothermal energy potential in Hungary exceeds the global average but lack of funding is a significant barrier. Solar energy potential amounts to several tens of thousands of MW, but the most significant limiting factor is large investment cost. Heat pumps have theoretical potential of several hundred PJ, but face funding limitations. Biogas production potential in theory could exceed as much as 20% of energy demand for 2020. Biofuels have significant potential, but are limited by the financial burden of replacing current vehicles. The target trajectory of renewable energy by end use in 2020 is to increase to: 18.9% of heating and cooling; 10.9% of electricity; and 10% of transport.<br />
<br />
The NREAP provides that the following will be financed: green economy development, research and development, adaptation to use of green electricity, biofuel benefits, tariffs and tax issues. It also aims to formulate incentives through regulatory and comprehensive programmes on sustainable energy management, renewable energy, simplification of authorisation procedures, establishment of regional energy agencies, and review of energy certification procedures for buildings. Social measures such as employment, national and regional training, social awareness-raising and network of energy experts are among the planned measures outlined in the action plan.
